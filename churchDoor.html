			<h4>TO</h4>
			<p class="verse">All little children here and there,<br>
			Beside the fire and everywhere,<br>
			With happy eyes of brown or blue,<br>
			This little book is meant for you!</p>
			
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/02.jpg"><img src="images/churchDoor/02-small.jpg" alt=""></a>
			<h4><a name="1">A WHILE AGO</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">The first time that I went to church<br>
			I was baptized, you know,<br>
			A tiny baby--brought to God<br>
			To learn how I should grow.<br>
			They made me God's own child that day,<br>
			And marked me with His cross,<br>
			To carry it through all my life<br>
			(It does not show, of course).</p>
			
			<p class="verse">I don't remember that day now,<br>
			But mother does, you see;<br>
			'Twas then she chose my Godparents<br>
			Who stood up there with me<br>
			And held me in their arms that time;<br>
			They promised for me too<br>
			The things the Church is asking me<br>
			To try my best to do.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/03.jpg"><img src="images/churchDoor/03-small.jpg" alt=""></a>
			<h4><a name="2">LIKE THE BIRDS</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">I hear the robins singing<br>
			Before my dreams are done,<br>
			They wake up very early<br>
			And sing songs every one;</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Their voices are so happy<br>
			They sound like hymns of prayer<br>
			To thank God every morning<br>
			For all His loving care.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">They sing to Him all through the day<br>
			Until the shadows fall:<br>
			I'll thank Him like the little birds<br>
			For caring for us all.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="3">PRAYER OF THANKSGIVING</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">For air and sunshine pure and sweet,<br>
			For grass that grows beneath our feet,<br>
			I thank Thee, heavenly Father.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">For flowers that all around us bloom,<br>
			For birds that sing in joyful tune,<br>
			I thank Thee, heavenly Father.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">For daily blessings full and free,<br>
			For all the care Thou givest me,<br>
			I thank Thee, heavenly Father.</p>
			
			<a name="4"><h4>WHAT TO DO BEFORE PRAYER</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">We fold our hands and close our eyes,<br>
			And kneel down, when we pray,<br>
			So we can keep our minds and thoughts<br>
			Upon the words we say.</p>
			
			<a name="5"><h4>AFTERWARD</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">And then our eyes we open wide<br>
			To see what we can do;<br>
			Unfold our hands so we can help,<br>
			They can be useful too;<br>
			Rise to our feet, so they will run<br>
			On errands through the day:<br>
			We like to feel that we can help,<br>
			Each in our special way.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/04.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/04-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="6"><h4>AT TIMES</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">But there are times we cannot kneel<br>
			Upon our knees to pray:<br>
			When we may wish to speak to God<br>
			At any time of day.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And then it means the same to Him<br>
			As if we knelt, I know,<br>
			If our hearts feel as though they kneel<br>
			In praying to Him so.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/05.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/05-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="7"><h4>MORNING PRAYERS</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Now I wake and see the light;<br>
			Thou, Lord, hast kept me through the night;<br>
			To Thee I lift my voice and pray<br>
			That Thou wilt keep me through the day.--Amen</p>
			
			<p class="verse">The morning bright with rosy light<br>
			Has waked me from my sleep;<br>
			Father, I know with loving care<br>
			Thy children Thou wilt keep.<br>
			All through the day, I humbly pray,<br>
			Be Thou my guard and guide,<br>
			My sins forgive, and let me live<br>
			Forever by Thy side.-Amen</p>
			
			<p class="verse">(For mother and baby to use together, pointing to eyes,
			etc.)</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Two little eyes to look to God,<br>
			Two little ears to hear His word,<br>
			Two little feet to walk His ways,<br>
			Hands to serve Him all my days.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">One little tongue to speak His truth,<br>
			One little heart for Him in youth,--<br>
			Take them, O Jesus, let them be<br>
			Always willing and true to Thee.</p>
			
			<a name="8"><h4>A MORNING HYMN</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">All things bright and beautiful,<br>
			All creatures great and small,<br>
			All things wise and wonderful,<br>
			The Lord God made them all.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Each little flower that opens,<br>
			Each little bird that sings,<br>
			He made their glowing colors,<br>
			He made their tiny wings.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">The tall trees in the greenwood,<br>
			The meadows where we play,<br>
			The rushes by the water,<br>
			We gather every day.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">He gave us eyes to see them,<br>
			And lips that we might tell<br>
			How great is God Almighty,<br>
			Who has made all things well.</p>
			
			<a name="9"><h4>WHICH ARE YOU?</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">In the woods close by our house<br>
			Live two little birds,<br>
			Each one sings its song to me,<br>
			But what different words!</p>
			
			<p class="verse">One sings all day happily<br>
			In all kinds of weather,<br>
			One complains the whole day through--<br>
			Both right there together.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">In the nearby bushes<br>
			One bird seems to say:<br>
			"Happy, happy, happy,<br>
			Happy all the day."</p>
			
			<p class="verse">On a sunny tree-top<br>
			Sits the other one,<br>
			"Oh, dear me," it's sighing,<br>
			(Not a bit of fun.)</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Happy heart or sad heart?<br>
			Whisper now to me<br>
			Which of these you'll copy;<br>
			I know which I'll be!</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/06.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/06-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="10"><h4>REMEMBERING</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">After I say my morning prayer<br>
			I wash myself and comb my hair,<br>
			And then I think I'll try my best<br>
			To be a good child--then I'm dressed.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And every time at school or play<br>
			When things go wrong, I try to say<br>
			Low to myself: "Be good today".</p>
			
			<p class="verse">But sometimes quicker than a wink<br>
			I'm cross before there's time to think;<br>
			Then I'm as sorry as can be<br>
			And tell God I'm ashamed of me.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">But with His help I hope I may<br>
			Remember it when next I play.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/07.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/07-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="11"><h4>"THANK YOU"</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">I have the dearest little dog,<br>
			As clever as can be,<br>
			Before he has his bone to eat<br>
			He looks right up at me<br>
			And says "I thank you" ("bow-wow-wow!" )<br>
			Before he eats at all,<br>
			And then he takes his bone away<br>
			Down by the garden wall.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">I cannot let our 'Frisky' dog<br>
			Be more polite than I<br>
			Remembering 'thank you' every time--<br>
			And so I really try.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/08.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/08-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="12"><h4>BEFORE WE EAT</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Before each meal we fold our hands,<br>
			Each standing at his place,<br>
			And say our "Thank You" then to God<br>
			In one short prayer of grace.</p>
			
			<a name="13"><h4>GRACE</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">"For all we eat and all we wear,<br>
			For daily bread and nightly care,<br>
			We thank Thee, heavenly Father.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">"Lord Jesus, be our Guest today,<br>
			And bless this food for us we pray,<br>
			That we may grow in Thine own way.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">We thank Thee for the flowers so sweet,<br>
			We thank Thee for the food we eat,<br>
			We thank Thee for the birds that sing,<br>
			We thank Thee, Lord, for everything.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Father of all, in Heaven above,<br>
			We thank Thee for Thy love;<br>
			Our food, our homes, and all we wear<br>
			Tell of Thy loving care.</p>
			
			<a name="14"><h4>TREASURES AND PLEASURES</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">When Jesus was a child, I know<br>
			He shared His favorite toys--<br>
			I wish I were as generous<br>
			With little girls and boys.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">There are some things I like to share<br>
			And even give away<br>
			And other things I'd rather have<br>
			Myself when I'm at play.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">But mother says it's selfishness<br>
			Unless I share them all;<br>
			I can spare many other things,<br>
			But I do love my ball.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And when we have a chance to go<br>
			To ride or anywhere--<br>
			A place I'd like to go myself--<br>
			My pleasures I should share,</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And really try to be more glad<br>
			To have another go,<br>
			When there are seats for only three<br>
			And I make four, you know.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/09.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/09-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="15"><h4>READY TO GO</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Before we go a-visiting<br>
			We bathe and dress so clean,<br>
			That mother may be pleased with us<br>
			And glad to have us seen;<br>
			And when we go to church each week<br>
			We make our hearts clean too,<br>
			And brush away all naughty things<br>
			That sometimes creep in through;<br>
			Till we are clean enough to go--<br>
			It will please God to see us so.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">At least one day in every week<br>
			We call at church this way,<br>
			Returning visits God makes us<br>
			At our house every day.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">In Thy house, Lord, and our house too,<br>
			Make us clean in all we do,<br>
			In all we think and all we say,<br>
			And more like Jesus every day.--Amen</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/10.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/10-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="16"><h4>AT CHURCH</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">When we walk through the door we go<br>
			To seats called pews, set row on row,<br>
			And then we kneel and say a prayer<br>
			To God, to make us holy there.</p>
			
			<a name="17"><h4>PRAYERS TO USE BEFORE THE SERVICE</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Help me to please Thee, Lord, I pray, And love Thee better every
			day.--Amen</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Heavenly Father, help us listen<br>
			To Thy words, that we may know<br>
			How to please Thee in this service;<br>
			Then, Lord, bless us as we go.--Amen</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Please help me, Lord, to pray and sing,<br>
			And teach my heart its love to bring.--Amen</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/11.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/11-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="18"><h4>THE CHOIR</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Then sometimes a procession comes<br>
			Of many choir boys,<br>
			To help us sing our hymns of praise<br>
			And thankfully rejoice.<br>
			They wear white robes like angels bright<br>
			And sing God's praises with delight.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/12.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/12-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="19"><h4>THE MINISTER</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">After the choir walks the priest<br>
			In long white surplice dressed,<br>
			He comes to say the prayers and talk<br>
			To us and all the rest;<br>
			And while he prays we listen hard,<br>
			All kneeling there, and then<br>
			We make that prayer our very own<br>
			By adding our "Amen ".</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/13.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/13-small.jpg"></a>
			<h4><a name="20">THE BIBLE LESSONS</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">And someone reads the Bible then,<br>
			Upon the lectern stand;<br>
			I like to hear the stories read<br>
			About the Holy Land,<br>
			And all the things that happened there<br>
			I like to hear him tell,--<br>
			Sometimes I know the stories too,<br>
			The ones that I love well.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/14.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/14-small.jpg"></a>
			<h4><a name="21">THE ORGAN</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">The organ music helps us sing,<br>
			And to the Lord our praises bring.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">The sound comes through big pipes, you know,<br>
			Like giant pencils in a row.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="22">THE LITANY</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">Sometimes a prayer-desk is placed<br>
			Down near us in the aisle,<br>
			And there the minister will kneel<br>
			And pray with us awhile.<br>
			We say the litany in turn<br>
			(The minister and we);<br>
			In olden times 'twas different,<br>
			They sang the litany,<br>
			All marching in processions then<br>
			As I should love to do;<br>
			I saw some pictures in a book<br>
			And that is how I knew.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/15.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/15-small.jpg"></a>
			<h4><a name="23">IN THE PULPIT</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">At sermon time our minister<br>
			Steps up the pulpit stair,<br>
			And standing there he bows his head<br>
			And says a little prayer.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And then he talks to us awhile<br>
			And tells us many things<br>
			About the teachings of our Lord,<br>
			Whose messages he brings.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And then, because he is our friend,<br>
			He tries to help us see<br>
			How we can help our Father's work--<br>
			How useful we can be.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/16.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/16-small.jpg"></a>
			<h4><a name="24">THE OFFERTORY</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">I earned two pennies yesterday,<br>
			And brought them safely all the way;</p>
			
			<p class="verse">They're for the offertory plate--<br>
			I keep them in my hand and wait</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Until the man stands at the pew,<br>
			And then I know just what to do:</p>
			
			<p class="verse">I drop the pennies with great care<br>
			Into the alms plate waiting there.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">For our Lord's work those pennies go--<br>
			And I am helping Him, you know.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/17.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/17-small.jpg"></a>
			<h4><a name="25">THE ALTAR</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">The Altar is all sweet with flowers<br>
			And pleasing in God's sight,<br>
			And in the center stands the cross--<br>
			So shining and so bright<br>
			To point the way to heaven above,<br>
			And tell us always of God's love.<br>
			The candles, gleaming, seem to say<br>
			They light God's message on its way.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">The Table of our Lord is spread<br>
			Where lighted candles shine,<br>
			And here the people come and kneel<br>
			For holy Bread and Wine;<br>
			And so shall I when I'm confirmed,<br>
			Holy Communion take,<br>
			And kneel there at the Altar too<br>
			For our Lord Jesus' sake.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/18.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/18-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="26"><h4>WHEN THE BISHOP COMES</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Once in a while our Bishop comes;<br>
			He sits in his own chair<br>
			That's just inside the altar rail<br>
			All ready for him there.<br>
			He wears a robe with large white sleeves<br>
			And talks to us and prays,<br>
			Because our Church is in his care<br>
			And he's our friend always.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">When there's a class to be confirmed<br>
			The congregation stands,<br>
			The class kneels at the altar rail,<br>
			Our Bishop lays his hands<br>
			Upon the head of each in turn,<br>
			And says a little prayer<br>
			Some day I'll be confirmed myself,<br>
			Then I'll be kneeling there.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="27">A PRAYER</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">(At the end of the service)<br>
			Now from Thy house we go our way,<br>
			Thy love be with us, Lord, we pray,<br>
			And bring us here another day.--Amen</p>
			
			<h4><a name="28">AFTER THE SERVICE</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">After we've said our prayers and sung,<br>
			And heard our Lord's own words,<br>
			We go again outside His church<br>
			And hear His chirping birds.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">We're sure the Lord is glad we came<br>
			Into His house to pray,<br>
			And know that He walks home with us<br>
			And helps us every day.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/19.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/19-small.jpg"></a>
			<h4><a name="29">OUR CORNER</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">At one end of our living room<br>
			We've found a little nook<br>
			Where we can squeeze behind the chairs<br>
			And take a picture-book;<br>
			We have that corner for our own,<br>
			Where we can slip away<br>
			And be all quiet with a book<br>
			At any time of day.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Our church which is so very large<br>
			Has now a corner there,<br>
			Where we can look at picture-books<br>
			And say a little prayer;<br>
			For everything is just our size,<br>
			And we can reach and see<br>
			The pretty pictures and the books--<br>
			All there for you and me.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">We need not wait till Sunday comes,<br>
			But go there any day<br>
			To our own corner in the church--<br>
			(If mother says we may).</p>
			
			<h4><a name="30">THE SUNBEAM</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">Today our baby tried to climb<br>
			The stairs alone,--I came in time<br>
			To see the little toddler there,<br>
			A golden sunbeam on his hair<br>
			And by his side,--I wondered why<br>
			The baby did not fall and cry.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Too frightened to know what to say<br>
			I stood and gazed there in dismay<br>
			And then it was explained to me,<br>
			I saw how it must surely be:--</p>
			
			<p class="verse">What looked like rays of clear sunlight<br>
			Were really angels' wings so bright,<br>
			Enfolding him with tender care<br>
			Upon the steep and dangerous stair.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/20.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/20-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="31"><h4>WON'T THEY BE HAPPY!</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">We love our little friends, the birds,<br>
			And when the ground's all snow<br>
			We'll give them crumbs and bits of food--<br>
			They're hungry then, I know.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And to the children who are sick,<br>
			Or cannot run and play,<br>
			We'll give some toys we like ourselves,<br>
			To make a happy day.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/21.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/21-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="32"><h4>AT SUPPER</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">I like to see our table spread<br>
			In shining candle-light,<br>
			With all the flowers we have brought<br>
			It is a lovely sight.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And when I watch the candles shine<br>
			Upon the flowers that way,<br>
			It makes me think about our church,<br>
			When people go to pray<br>
			At our Lord's Altar Table fair,<br>
			With all the lights and flowers there.</p>
			
			<a name="33"><h4>A LITANY FOR CHILDREN</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Jesus, from Thy throne on high,<br>
			Far above the bright blue sky,<br>
			Look on us with loving eye:<br>
			Hear us, Holy Jesus.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Be Thou with us every day,<br>
			In our work and in our play<br>
			When we learn and when we pray:<br>
			Hear us, Holy Jesus.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">When we lie asleep at night,<br>
			Ever may Thy angels bright<br>
			Keep us safe till morning light:<br>
			Hear us, Holy Jesus.--Amen</p>
			
			<a name="34"><h4>EVENING PRAYERS</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me;<br>
			Bless Thy little lamb tonight:<br>
			Through the darkness be Thou near me,<br>
			Keep me safe till morning light.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">All this day Thy hand has led me,<br>
			And I thank Thee for Thy care;<br>
			Thou hast warmed me, clothed and fed me;<br>
			Listen to my evening prayer.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Let my sins be all forgiven;<br>
			Bless the friends I love so well:<br>
			Take us all at last to heaven,<br>
			Happy there with Thee to dwell. Amen</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Now I lay me down to sleep,<br>
			I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep,<br>
			Thy love go with me all the night,<br>
			And wake me with the morning light.--Amen</p>
			
			<a name="35"><h4>EVENING HYMN</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Now the day is over,<br>
			Night is drawing nigh,<br>
			Shadows of the evening<br>
			Steal across the sky.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Jesus, give the weary<br>
			Calm and sweet repose;<br>
			With Thy tenderest blessing<br>
			May our eyelids close.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Grant to little children<br>
			Visions bright of Thee;<br>
			Guard the sailors tossing<br>
			On the deep blue sea.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">Through the long night watches<br>
			May Thine angels spread<br>
			Their white wings above me<br>
			Watching 'round my bed.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">When the morning wakens,<br>
			Then may I arise<br>
			Pure and fresh and sinless<br>
			In Thy holy eyes.--Amen</p>
			
			<h4><a name="36">THE STARS</a></h4>
			<p class="verse">After we sing our evening hymn,<br>
			And when our prayers are said,<br>
			We like to wish the stars "good night"<br>
			Before we hop in bed.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And father tells us stories, too,<br>
			Real truly ones, you know,<br>
			About the wonderful bright star<br>
			That shone so long ago,</p>
			
			<p class="verse">That showed the Wise Men where to come,<br>
			And led them all the way,<br>
			Shining above the manger bed<br>
			Where Baby Jesus lay.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">I know these stars mean something now--<br>
			That He is here tonight,<br>
			In all the houses, out-doors too,<br>
			Under the stars so bright.</p>

			<a name="37"><h4>THE BEST GIFT</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">We children sat, on Christmas Eve,<br>
			Around our father's chair;<br>
			"Now tell me, children," questioned he,<br>
			(Stroking the baby's hair),<br>
			"The finest and most precious gift<br>
			That God gave Christmas Day".<br>
			Then brother John said, "Santa Claus,<br>
			It's Santa Claus, I say."<br>
			I thought a while and then I saw<br>
			The baby's curly head;<br>
			"I think it's babies, just like ours,<br>
			The finest gift," I said.<br>
			"That's very nearly right, my dear,"<br>
			And father's eyes were bright;<br>
			Said Dicky-boy, "The Christ Child,"<br>
			And he had guessed it right.</p>

			<a name="38"><h4>BIRTHDAYS</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Upon the birthday of our Lord<br>
			(And that is Christmas Day)<br>
			We like to give all kinds of things,<br>
			New books and games to play.<br>
			Then when our birthdays come around<br>
			And every year we grow,<br>
			We can give other kinds of gifts--<br>
			The kind that do not show.<br>
			By helping more and more each year<br>
			I'll give myself, you see,<br>
			And every year there's more to give<br>
			Because there's more of me!</p>
			
			<a name="39"><h4>OUR COUNTRY'S BIRTHDAY</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Our Country has a birthday too,<br>
			The fourth day of July,<br>
			And when we see our starry flag<br>
			Up high against the sky<br>
			We stand and make a fine salute<br>
			The flag's our Country's sign;<br>
			Our Country is God's Country too<br>
			As well as yours and mine,<br>
			And we must try to keep things right,<br>
			To help it every way,<br>
			That God may be so proud of it<br>
			And prouder every day.</p>
			
			<a name="40"><h4>A PRAYER FOR OUR COUNTRY</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">Father, who made our native land,<br>
			Oh, help and guide it with Thy hand,<br>
			And lead it ever in Thy way,<br>
			To help Thy kingdom come, we pray.--Amen</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/24.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/24-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="41"><h4>AT EASTER</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">The Easter church bells seem so glad!<br>
			Such wondrous news they bring!<br>
			They tell us all our Lord is risen,<br>
			As joyously they ring;<br>
			And that our Lord still lives with us<br>
			And blesses us today,<br>
			In every country in the world<br>
			Both near and far away.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And God loves all these countries too,<br>
			So we must be their friend,<br>
			And every year when Easter comes<br>
			An offering we'll send.</p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/25.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/25-small.jpg"></a>
			<a name="42"><h4>THANKSGIVING</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">God shows that He remembers us,<br>
			In all our work and play<br>
			There is so much to thank Him for,<br>
			We have Thanksgiving Day.<!--SELECTION--></p>
			
			<a href="images/churchDoor/26.jpg"><img alt="" src="images/churchDoor/26-small.jpg"></a>
			<!--/SELECTION-->
			<a name="43"><h4>"FORGET ME NOT"</h4></a>
			<p class="verse">I like to think the Christ Child played--<br>
			When He was small like me--<br>
			Out in the fields of that far land<br>
			Away across the sea.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And best of all the lovely flowers<br>
			(If there it ever grew)<br>
			I know He loved that blossom pure,<br>
			The color of heaven's blue.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And when the gentle mother called<br>
			The Christ Child from His play,<br>
			He, whispering to the little flower,<br>
			"Forget me not" would say.</p>
			
			<p class="verse">And when He says that in my ear<br>
			I hope that I may always hear.</p>
